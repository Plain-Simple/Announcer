A program that that helps automate the calling of competitors at Rubik's Cube competitions by letting organizers pre-record competitor names and other messages. 

Names can be pre-recorded and placed into the audio/names/ folder, event names can be pre-recorded and placed into audio/events/, and other audio can go into the audio/ folder. This program reads from the WCA workbook spreadsheet specified as the argument, and automatically places competitors in their correct events. Run the help function for more information. Please open an issue if you have found a bug or would like to see a new feature implemented.
